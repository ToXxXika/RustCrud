rocket needs rust nightly mode to works
CMD: (rustup default nightly)
CMD: (cargo install diesel_cli) to use diesel commands

CMD :(diesel setup) will create migration up & down
  up : for everything we do on the database
  down : to undo any operation
  // custom migration cmd : diesel migration generate (file name)
      //result : 2 files ups and downs

     PS : apparently new diesel version won't generate default ups and downs
CMD :(diesel migration run) will run ur migrations
CMD : (diesel migration redo) will run down sql then up sql
